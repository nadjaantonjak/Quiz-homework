1. Believing i will be successful with this course and in my future career is what motivated me through out this assignment. It alows me to practice and apply my knowladge learnt  throughout my classes hopefully shocasing improvement and progress.

2. This project was bulit to test my skills in HTML, css and javascript as all three work together to shocase my final results. Throughout completing this assignment and going over class work has provided me with a greater understanding of different functions and how to implement different tasks such as generating a countdown timer which has evolved my skills.

3. With practicing these quizes, studence like myself do alot of critical thinking and get into a habit of innocative learning. Game mechanics are seen into learning process, they helf students understand the weaker areas with instant feedback. Along with this great benifit of creating these quizes, developing the quiz from scratch jas strengthned my development skills aswell as educating me in the factual part i can practice once ive completed my quiz.

4. What i learnt and skills ive streigthned while developing my quiz 
- Advancing development with html and css
- Setting up variables in Javascript code
- Adding questions and answer options
- Generating countdown timer
- Creating different files for different sections of the quiz 
- Linking all files together to load quiz and make it reactive

I believe my quiz project is set to stand out due to the clear simple display it contains, its not over done and confusing, the instructions are vivid and clear. yet, i have benefitialy used css to draw attention to important sections on the page that need to stand out and be seen. Everything is put in a specific place spaced out and eye catching colours atr used for important sections and symbols. Along with these benifits i believe ive used intresting yet useful questions that can enhance learning for people doing the quiz.
